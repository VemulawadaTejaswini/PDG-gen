Don't let that studying and grades consume you
Just live life young

What do you think? What do you think?
1st on Billboard, what do you think of it
Next is a Grammy, what do you think of it
However you think, Iâ€™m sorry, but shit, I have no fcking interest

I'm standing on top of my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop
