If you want to aim high, aim high
Don't let that studying and grades consume you
Just live life young

What do you think? What do you think?
1st on Billboard, what do you think of it
Next is a Grammy, what do you think of it
However you think, I’m sorry, but shit, I have no fucking interest
*******************************
Higher, higher, even higher, to the point you won’t even be able to see me
