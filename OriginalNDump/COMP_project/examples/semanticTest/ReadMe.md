# Semantic Analysis

This test was specifically designed to showcase the semantic error reporting capabilities of our tool and as such it is filled with a wide array of those errors.

	* Duplicate Variable declarations;
	* Undefined variables in many different contexts;
	* Wrong return values;
	* Invalid number of arguments in method calls;
	* Undeclared methods;
	* Undefined fields...

All the errors contained in the file will be displayed on the GUI of the tool.

NOTE: The displayed graph is not guaranteed to be correct due to the errors.
